<b><u><i>Another lawsuit filed against former youth baseball coach, accusing him of sexual misconduct</i></u></b>
  </h1>
  
   <p>
     former Staten Island youth baseball coach, who's been accused of molestation by several former players, 
    was hit with another lawsuit this week, this time by a New Jersey man alleging sexual misconduct in the mid-1970s.
   </br>"Joe Doe2" filed a New York state civil complaint, accusing Anthony Sagona of forcing him to masturbate in front of the coach in 1974 or 1975
    when the plaintiff was 14 or 15 years old and living on Staten Island.

    As Mexico looks back on the 500th anniversary of the Spanish conquest of the Aztecs,
     an award-winning filmmaker wants his fellow Mexicans and
     others to confront their national identity — and re-examine how the legacy of colonial history still impacts people today.
   </br> “Nationalism tells you where you come from so it can tell you where you’re going,”
    Rodrigo Reyes told NBC News. “I think it’s important to feel proud of where you’re coming from.
     I’m super proud of being from Mexico. But I do believe that some of these narratives are so simplistic, 
   so black and white, that they damage our understanding of who we are and how we’re interconnected.”

     students by their preferred gender names and pronouns.

 It also mandates access for students to restrooms and locker rooms that “correspond to their consistently asserted gender identity.”

<h1><b><i><u>Pelosi announces House staff can now make almost $200K</u></i></b></h1>
    <p>
        WASHINGTON — House staff can now make up to $199,300 a year, Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced Thursday.
        "This important action follows steps taken over the last two Congress to make the House more inclusive, open, 
        and representative of the full range of voices and values of our communities," Pelosi, D-Calif., said in a letter to Democratic members.
    </br>The decision to raise the maximum annual pay rate was meant to aid in recruitment and was recommended by House Administration
     Committee Chair Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif., Pelosi said.
     The annual maximum pay for selected House staff in 2020 was $173,900, according to the Congressional Research Service.
 The House Select Committee on the Modernization of Congress 
 held a hearing earlier this year on ways to improve staff and retain top-tier talent.

<h1><u><i><b>Texas commissioner says gender-affirmation surgery for minors is 'child abuse'</b></i></u></h1>

    <p>
        The head of the Texas department charged with protecting the welfare of the state’s children said Wednesday that gender-affirming surgery,
         which she refers to as “genital mutilation,” constitutes “child abuse” under state law.
    </br>“Such mutilation may cause a ‘genuine threat of substantial harm from physical injury to the child,’” Jaime Masters,
     commissioner of the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services, wrote in a letter addressed to Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican.
     “This surgical procedure physically alters a child’s genitalia for non-medical purposes potentially inflicting irreversible harm to children’s bodies. Generally,
     children in the care and custody of a parent lack the legal capacity to consent to surgical treatments, making them more vulnerable.”
